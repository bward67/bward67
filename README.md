I love this crazy journey I am currently on learning how to code. It satisfies my creative outlet and and my massive need to be productive, (which I believe may come from growing up on a farm!). 

Waking up every day and knowing that I can spend it learning Front End Development makes me smile and puts a spring in my step. 

Currently, I am working on my Portfolio which will be awesome. Watch this space...
