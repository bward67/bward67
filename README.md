I love this crazy journey I am currently on, learning how to code. It fulfills both my creative drive and my strong need to stay productive, (the latter, which I believe may have come from growing up on a farm!). 

Waking up every day and knowing that I can spend it learning Front End Development makes me smile and puts a spring in my step. 

Currently, I am working on my Portfolio which will be awesome. Watch this space...
